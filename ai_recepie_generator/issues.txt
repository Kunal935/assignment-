Issues with Rasa
1.Initially, I tried using a large dataset (~13K rows), but Rasa's server failed to connect properly.
  To resolve this, I switched to a static approach, but then actions.py stopped working.

2.Finally, I simplified the project to work with only three sample dishes:

  Paneer Butter Masala

  Chicken Biryani

  Chole Bhature

  I hope this version works smoothly without errors.
